		<h1>History</h1>
		<h2>This website and the DPR Korea Tour agency began as the result of the following agreements with aligned nations.</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>A pact of non-aggression and strategic interest cooperation.</li>
			<li>A free travel agreement, allowing visa free travel between both countries.</li>
			<li>A emergency routing agreement, allowing flights destined for other destinations, and origination from each respective country to route into the other if need be, as both nations are limited in passable airspace due to sanctions.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>This agreement was signed in Tehran and Addis Abba, as well as similar agreements being reached with Somalia, Eritrea, and Angola.</h2>
		<h2>These agreements helped to expand the possibility of international travel to and from the DPRK, previously limited to only China and the USSR.</h2>
		<h2>We built this website to aid, and encourage prospective tourists to the great People's Republic of Korea!</h2>
